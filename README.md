## Deaditt



### `Description`

Deaditt is an application built over 2 weeks which catalogs all of the live music performed by the rock band the Grateful Dead between the years 1965-1995. The site features the abilities to search for all shows, see the unique setlist/songs from each show, load lyrics, connect to spotify, add/delete comments, edit your profile, follow other users and have them follow you. 

### `Installation`

To view the site, I recommend going to the live [deaditt](https://deaditt-app.herokuapp.com/) site hosted on heroku.<br><br>
If you'd like you can also fork and load the site in developement, in conjunction with the react frontend [here](https://github.com/elandau91/gd-frontend). When loading the site through the repos, make sure to run the rails server on the backend before doing the npm start or yarn start on the frontend.
